# 📊 Census Data Analysis
This project was developed as part of my MSc in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. The goal was to simulate a real-world data science task for local government planning using a mock UK census dataset.

## 🧠 Project Goal
To analyze a fictional town’s population and recommend:

-  What infrastructure to build on an empty plot of land.

-  Where to prioritise public investment based on demographic and economic trends.

## 📁 Dataset
Simulated census-style dataset (9543 rows)

Features include: age, gender, occupation, religion, household, marital status, infirmity, and more

Data intentionally **included inconsistencies and missing values** to reflect real-world challenges

## 🔧 Key Tasks
✔️ **Data cleaning**: imputation, standardisation, error handling

📊 **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)**: visualisations and trend detection

🧪 **Feature engineering**: commuter flag, age bins, employment status

📌 **Policy recommendations**: based on quantitative insights

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python

- Libraries: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib

- Jupyter Notebook


## 📸 Visual Highlights
- Age pyramids

- Household occupancy distribution

- Employment and unemployment breakdown

- Religion distribution


## 📈 Final Recommendations
- Infrastructure: Build a train station to support the town’s large commuter population

- Investment: Fund employment & training programmes, particularly for mid-career adults
